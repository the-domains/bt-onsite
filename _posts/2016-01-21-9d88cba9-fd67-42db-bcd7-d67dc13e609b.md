Why Offer Corporate Massage?
A BodyTechniques Review
On-Site Corporate Massage, the Gift that Keeps Giving
By offering employees massage, you decrease stress levels which are linked to high blood
pressure, diabetes and a host of circulatory and heart diseases. Massage strengthens the
immune system so employees no longer have to fall prey to every opportunistic disease
that comes along. This alone will decrease unscheduled absences and positively affect the
company's bottom line.
By offering on-site corporate massage you enhance productivity. The gift of massage
increases morale, improves focus and prevents and treats repetitive stress injuries. On-site
massage offers your employees a benefit that will continually benefit your company---in
decreased absences, increased productivity and, most importantly, revenue.
Health, the Best Reason of All
When CNN and Fortune 500 develop their "Best Companies to Work For" lists, they begin
by looking at how companies assist employees at balancing workplace pressures, health
and daily life responsibilities. Onsite corporate massage is the employee benefit that not
only reduces workplace stress, but also teaches employees healthy living basics, while
boosting morale, and offering treatments for repetitive stress injuries, which are so
prevalent in today's workplace.
Massage benefits immune system. According to a 2010 Japanese study from the Hirosaki
University Graduate School of Health Service, "leg massage may promote psychosocial
relaxation and reinforce a first-line host defense with an increase in secretion of
antimicrobial peptides." In another randomized in Sweden, thirty women with breast
cancer were studied looking at the effects of massage on the immune system. The results
found a decrease in the deterioration of NK (natural killer) cell activity, as well as a
decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.
Your employees also get the benefit of trained therapists who can discuss appropriate
stretching techniques to combat low back pain, carpal tunnel or other repetitive stress
injuries which can cost companies in workman's comp and extended leave of absences.
Avoiding Worker's Comp Claims for Repetitive Stress
Repetitive stress injuries (RSI) are prevalent in office settings. The problem is sitting in one
position in front of the computer throughout the workday. Most common Repetitive Stress
disorders---including carpal tunnel and tendonitis---create symptoms of aches, pain, tingling,
swelling, loss of joint movement and loss of strength in the affected area(s). Many factors play a
role in developing RSI including: repetition, stress, cold working environments, poor ergonomics
and prolonged work periods without adequate breaks.
Massage is a clinically proven treatment for repetitive stress injuries. Massage can lengthen and
stretch tight muscles, as well as break down scar tissue and reduce adhesions on affected
muscles and tendons. Massage can reduce discomfort and inflammation, increase flexibility and
help employees recover the sense of well-being and focus that chronic pain often takes away.
For employers, preventative measures like massage can reduce worker's comp claims, saving
thousands per employee in lost productivity and extended paid leave.
Morale Boosts the Bottom Line
Corporate massage is the HR benefit that is good for the employees and the company
bottom line. On-site massage builds morale for employees, which reduces absenteeism
and increases on site productivity, while providing the mental stimulation, stress calming
and immune boosting benefits that further reduce unexpected employee absences.
According to U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics companies lose an estimated $100 billion
every year because of absenteeism. On-site corporate massage is an effective solution for
businesses hemorrhaging funds through revenue associated with lost productivity.
Good morale in an office can be quite subjective. It is an emotional reading of the
atmosphere amongst employees on the job. Do employees like coming to work? Do
employees feel like an important part in the overall structure and success of the business?
Do employees feel like their health and happiness matter to higher-ups?
If any of these answers are affirmative, you have a company that has high morale, which
means, employees are more involved with what profits the company and are more likely to
spend time and effort working out solutions to benefit the company.
Measuring morale has always been a difficult issue because the costs associated with poor
morale are not hard costs, and are often hard to track and quantify. But in the case of
unscheduled absenteeism the costs can be more clearly defined.
According to the 2003 CCH Unscheduled Absence Survey, employers overall set aside an
average of 4.4 percent of their budgets for absenteeism. However, when morale is factored
in the results budgeting varies significantly. The surveyors found that organizations with
'Poor to Fair' morale set aside 5.3 percent of their budgets to cover the costs of absent
workers compared to 3.7 percent in organizations with 'Good to Very Good' morale. That
difference of almost 1.5% can amount to a significant amount of money.
Massaging Morale & Productivity
Offering company sponsored or co-pay (employer and employee paid) massage at work
demonstrates to your employees that their health and happiness matter. Massage boosts
morale by reaffirming that your company cares about finding ways to reduce stress and
relieve work-related aches and pains.
But massage benefits more than company morale. Dr. Mark Rapaport's study published in
the Fall of 2010 reveals Swedish massage with moderate pressure decreases stress
hormones, reduces blood pressure and boost the immune system. According to Rapaport,
Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles, "We're finding biological changes associated with a single
massage session," he says. "That's saying something."
The decrease in stress levels and blood pressure also correlates to clear thinking and
increased productivity. In a Swedish clinical study emergency room nurses, whose jobs are
highly stressful and emotional, were given massage. Findings indicate tactile massage
contributed "to reduced levels of stress and pain and increased work ability." The massage
relieved stress, allowing the brain to move beyond fight/flight response, allowing for
increased reasoning, focus and clarity.
