A BodyTechniques Review On-Site Corporate Massage, the Gift that Keeps Giving By offering employees massage, you decrease stress levels which are linked to high blood pressure, diabetes and a host of circulatory and heart
    diseases. Massage strengthens the immune system so employees no longer have to fall prey to every opportunistic disease that comes along. This alone will decrease unscheduled absences and positively affect the company’s bottom line. By offering on-site
    corporate massage you enhance productivity. The gift of massage increases morale, improves focus and prevents and treats repetitive stress injuries. On-site massage offers your employees a benefit that will continually benefit your company—in decreased
    absences, increased productivity and, most importantly, revenue. Health, the Best Reason of All When CNN and Fortune 500 develop their “Best Companies to Work For” lists, they begin by looking at how companies assist employees at balancing workplace
    pressures, health and daily life responsibilities. Onsite corporate massage is the employee benefit that not only reduces workplace stress, but also teaches employees healthy living basics, while boosting morale, and offering treatments for repetitive
    stress injuries, which are so prevalent in today’s workplace. Massage benefits immune system. According to a 2010 Japanese study from the Hirosaki University Graduate School of Health Service, “leg massage may promote psychosocial relaxation and reinforce
    a first-line host defense with an increase in secretion of antimicrobial peptides.” In another randomized in Sweden, thirty women with breast cancer were studied looking at the effects of massage on the immune system. The results found a decrease
    in the deterioration of NK (natural killer) cell activity, as well as a decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. Your employees also get the benefit of trained therapists who can discuss appropriate stretching techniques to combat low back pain,
    carpal tunnel or other repetitive stress injuries which can cost companies in workman’s comp and extended leave of absences. Avoiding Worker’s Comp Claims for Repetitive Stress Repetitive stress injuries (RSI) are prevalent in office settings. The
    problem is sitting in one position in front of the computer throughout the workday. Most common Repetitive Stress disorders—including carpal tunnel and tendonitis—create symptoms of aches, pain, tingling, swelling, loss of joint movement and loss
    of strength in the affected area(s). Many factors play a role in developing RSI including: repetition, stress, cold working environments, poor ergonomics and prolonged work periods without adequate breaks. Massage is a clinically proven treatment
    for repetitive stress injuries. Massage can lengthen and stretch tight muscles, as well as break down scar tissue and reduce adhesions on affected muscles and tendons. Massage can reduce discomfort and inflammation, increase flexibility and help employees
    recover the sense of well-being and focus that chronic pain often takes away. For employers, preventative measures like massage can reduce worker’s comp claims, saving thousands per employee in lost productivity and extended paid leave. Morale Boosts
    the Bottom Line Corporate massage is the HR benefit that is good for the employees and the company bottom line. On-site massage builds morale for employees, which reduces absenteeism and increases on site productivity, while providing the mental stimulation,
    stress calming and immune boosting benefits that further reduce unexpected employee absences. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics companies lose an estimated $100 billion every year because of absenteeism. On-site corporate massage is
    an effective solution for businesses hemorrhaging funds through revenue associated with lost productivity. Good morale in an office can be quite subjective. It is an emotional reading of the atmosphere amongst employees on the job. Do employees like
    coming to work? Do employees feel like an important part in the overall structure and success of the business? Do employees feel like their health and happiness matter to higher-ups? If any of these answers are affirmative, you have a company that
    has high morale, which means, employees are more involved with what profits the company and are more likely to spend time and effort working out solutions to benefit the company. Measuring morale has always been a difficult issue because the costs
    associated with poor morale are not hard costs, and are often hard to track and quantify. But in the case of unscheduled absenteeism the costs can be more clearly defined. According to the 2003 CCH Unscheduled Absence Survey, employers overall set
    aside an average of 4.4 percent of their budgets for absenteeism. However, when morale is factored in the results budgeting varies significantly. The surveyors found that organizations with ‘Poor to Fair’ morale set aside 5.3 percent of their budgets
    to cover the costs of absent workers compared to 3.7 percent in organizations with ‘Good to Very Good’ morale. That difference of almost 1.5% can amount to a significant amount of money. Massaging Morale & Productivity Offering company sponsored or
    co-pay (employer and employee paid) massage at work demonstrates to your employees that their health and happiness matter. Massage boosts morale by reaffirming that your company cares about finding ways to reduce stress and relieve work-related aches
    and pains. But massage benefits more than company morale. Dr. Mark Rapaport’s study published in the Fall of 2010 reveals Swedish massage with moderate pressure decreases stress hormones, reduces blood pressure and boost the immune system. According
    to Rapaport, Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, "We're finding biological changes associated with a single massage session," he says. "That's saying something." The
    decrease in stress levels and blood pressure also correlates to clear thinking and increased productivity. In a Swedish clinical study emergency room nurses, whose jobs are highly stressful and emotional, were given massage. Findings indicate tactile
    massage contributed “to reduced levels of stress and pain and increased work ability.” The massage relieved stress, allowing the brain to move beyond fight/flight response, allowing for increased reasoning, focus and clarity.</p><picture>

Massage strengthens the\nimmune system so employees no longer have to fall prey to every opportunistic disease\nthat comes along. This alone will decrease unscheduled absences and positively affect the\ncompany’s bottom line.\nBy offering on-site corporate massage you enhance productivity. The gift of massage\nincreases morale, improves focus and prevents and treats repetitive stress injuries. On-site\nmassage offers your employees a benefit that will continually benefit your company—in\ndecreased absences, increased productivity and, most importantly, revenue.\nHealth, the Best Reason of All\nWhen CNN and Fortune 500 develop their “Best Companies to Work For” lists, they begin\nby looking at how companies assist employees at balancing workplace pressures, health\nand daily life responsibilities. Onsite corporate massage is the employee benefit that not\nonly reduces workplace stress, but also teaches employees healthy living basics, while\nboosting morale, and offering treatments for repetitive stress injuries, which are so\nprevalent in today’s workplace.\nMassage benefits immune system. According to a 2010 Japanese study from the Hirosaki\nUniversity Graduate School of Health Service, “leg massage may promote psychosocial\nrelaxation and reinforce a first-line host defense with an increase in secretion of\nantimicrobial peptides.” In another randomized in Sweden, thirty women with breast\ncancer were studied looking at the effects of massage on the immune system. The results\nfound a decrease in the deterioration of NK (natural killer) cell activity, as well as a\ndecrease in blood pressure and heart rate.\nYour employees also get the benefit of trained therapists who can discuss appropriate\nstretching techniques to combat low back pain, carpal tunnel or other repetitive stress\ninjuries which can cost companies in workman’s comp and extended leave of absences.\nAvoiding Worker’s Comp Claims for Repetitive Stress\nRepetitive stress injuries (RSI) are prevalent in office settings. The problem is sitting in one\nposition in front of the computer throughout the workday. Most common Repetitive Stress\ndisorders—including carpal tunnel and tendonitis—create symptoms of aches, pain, tingling,\nswelling, loss of joint movement and loss of strength in the affected area(s). Many factors play a\nrole in developing RSI including: repetition, stress, cold working environments, poor ergonomics\nand prolonged work periods without adequate breaks.\nMassage is a clinically proven treatment for repetitive stress injuries. Massage can lengthen and\nstretch tight muscles, as well as break down scar tissue and reduce adhesions on affected\nmuscles and tendons. Massage can reduce discomfort and inflammation, increase flexibility and\nhelp employees recover the sense of well-being and focus that chronic pain often takes away.\nFor employers, preventative measures like massage can reduce worker’s comp claims, saving\nthousands per employee in lost productivity and extended paid leave.\nMorale Boosts the Bottom Line\nCorporate massage is the HR benefit that is good for the employees and the company\nbottom line. On-site massage builds morale for employees, which reduces absenteeism\nand increases on site productivity, while providing the mental stimulation, stress calming\nand immune boosting benefits that further reduce unexpected employee absences.\nAccording to U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics companies lose an estimated $100 billion\nevery year because of absenteeism. On-site corporate massage is an effective solution for\nbusinesses hemorrhaging funds through revenue associated with lost productivity.\nGood morale in an office can be quite subjective. It is an emotional reading of the\natmosphere amongst employees on the job. Do employees like coming to work? Do\nemployees feel like an important part in the overall structure and success of the business?\nDo employees feel like their health and happiness matter to higher-ups?\nIf any of these answers are affirmative, you have a company that has high morale, which\nmeans, employees are more involved with what profits the company and are more likely to\nspend time and effort working out solutions to benefit the company.\nMeasuring morale has always been a difficult issue because the costs associated with poor\nmorale are not hard costs, and are often hard to track and quantify. But in the case of\nunscheduled absenteeism the costs can be more clearly defined.\nAccording to the 2003 CCH Unscheduled Absence Survey, employers overall set aside an\naverage of 4.4 percent of their budgets for absenteeism. However, when morale is factored\nin the results budgeting varies significantly. The surveyors found that organizations with\n‘Poor to Fair’ morale set aside 5.3 percent of their budgets to cover the costs of absent\nworkers compared to 3.7 percent in organizations with ‘Good to Very Good’ morale. That\ndifference of almost 1.5% can amount to a significant amount of money.\nMassaging Morale & Productivity\nOffering company sponsored or co-pay (employer and employee paid) massage at work\ndemonstrates to your employees that their health and happiness matter. Massage boosts\nmorale by reaffirming that your company cares about finding ways to reduce stress and\nrelieve work-related aches and pains.\nBut massage benefits more than company morale. Dr. Mark Rapaport’s study published in\nthe Fall of 2010 reveals Swedish massage with moderate pressure decreases stress\nhormones, reduces blood pressure and boost the immune system. According to Rapaport,\nChairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences at Cedars-Sinai\nMedical Center in Los Angeles, \"We're finding biological changes associated with a single\nmassage session,\" he says. \"That's saying something.\"\nThe decrease in stress levels and blood pressure also correlates to clear thinking and\nincreased productivity. In a Swedish clinical study emergency room nurses, whose jobs are\nhighly stressful and emotional, were given massage. Findings indicate tactile massage\ncontributed “to reduced levels of stress and pain and increased work ability.” The massage\nrelieved stress, allowing the brain to move beyond fight/flight response, allowing for\nincreased reasoning, focus and clarity.","_html":"<p>Why Offer Corporate Massage?\nA BodyTechniques Review\nOn-Site Corporate Massage, the Gift that Keeps Giving\nBy offering employees massage, you decrease stress levels which are linked to high blood\npressure, diabetes and a host of circulatory and heart diseases.
